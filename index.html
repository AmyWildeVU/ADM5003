            <p>I'm trying to fill in the copy without using lorem ipsum, which is surprisingly difficult! This is somewhat ironic given that I love words and language, but here I am struggling with finding words to find this space.</p>
            <p>So, perhaps what I'll do is tell you about my weekend. I went camping for the first time as an adult this past weekend. I bought all of the things I thought I'd need but it turns out that I overcompensated somewhat for my lack of camping experience.</p>
            <p>I went out to Foxbar Falls in Queensland's Granite Belt region. There was pretty much no phone reception, which I found challenging as a perma-online millennial. Surprisingly quickly, I adapted to the lack of digital availability and dove into a more analogue existence. Soon, I was feeling more relaxed than I have in... probably about 18 months.</p>
            <p>We were all out there to celebrate my work friend's 50th birthday. She had an amazing time and is now off on a six-month adventure around Australia with her two dogs - Mabel and Charlie - and her cat, Harry. I'm really looking forward to seeing her adventures as she makes her way around the country.</p>
